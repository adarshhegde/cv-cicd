  details: [
    -  #underline[*Microservices Development:*] Developed and maintained scalable microservices using *Golang*; utilizing *gRPC* & *Apache Thrift* for inter-service communication and serving traffic via *REST APIs*.
    - #underline[*Email Service:*] Engineered a high-throughput *email service* with Golang and *Apache Kafka* processing upward of *10,000 emails* per second; via *AWS SES* and *SendGrid*, with robust support for handling failures; directly *saving ~\$900/month* in operational costs.
    - #underline[*Advertisement Listing using Gen AI*]: Led the development of the company's first *AI-native feature*, an end-to-end pipeline to automate ad listings. By leveraging *Google Gemini Vision* and a RAG model with Qdrant Vector DB, the system *replaced a 17-step manual process*, enabling users to instantly create *accurate*, pre-filled ads from user uploaded images.
    - #underline[*Image CDN:*] Re-architected *NodeJS* based *image service* into *Golang*, allowing for efficient and fast transformations of image assets, utilizing *s3 pre-signed URLs* for efficient uploads.
    - #underline[*Platform team contributions:*] Optimized Dockerfiles to reduce image sizes and build times for multiple services by implementing *multi-stage builds* and effective caching. Developed a Golang CLI tool to automate Kubernetes staging environment deployments and commit them directly to the *ArgoCD* Git repository.
    - #underline[*Databases:*] Improved database performance by *optimizing queries*, *profiling*, and implementing *indexing strategies*, and Redis caching layers.
    - #underline[*Job Scheduler Enhancements:*] Enhanced the in-house scheduler service (Golang + MongoDB) with *exponential backoff* retries, improving resilience and stability under high load.
    - #underline[*Search Engine Enhancements:*] Refactored and optimized the *Elasticsearch*-based search service codebase; identified and fixed a critical race condition increasing search API success rate from ~40% to *over 99%* in production.
    - #underline[*JSON-to-gRPC Gateway*]: Developed a *REST API Gateway* enabling external clients to consume internal gRPC services seamlessly, secured with robust authentication and rate-limiting mechanisms.
